# SDEV220GroupProject

I created individual sandbox branches that will be copies of the main branch so we can all work on our own copies of the program once we start putting things together so that we do not erase each other's progress or accidentally delete the whole thing.

when you log in if you click the "main" dropdown box it should be in the top right area underneath code isuues pull requests line there will be an option to see all branches I made one for each of us with our names on it.
then once we find someting that needs to be added to the main section we can add it and the way I understand it our individual branches should be updated, I am not 100 percent on that Im looking into that now.
well it doesnt work exactly like i thought but we can do a pull request to merge the changes from one branch to another and at least work from the most recent copy of main branch but i feel like that may delete the progress you have in the branch that you merge with the main branch
